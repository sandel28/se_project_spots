In the video I was talking about how its my first time doing something like this. someone told me to describe it like im explaining it to someone that doesnt know anything about it .I spoke about meta tags and how the link you the internet, and link tags link to css and other things you may use to work with html .I spoke about padding margins and how to use the inspect in the google chrome to help as a tool html is simple if you break it down like header section footers and divs to help .class lets you customize the html to a point I know java script lets you make it live and interactive . in the terminal it lets you have full control of your files to creating and deleting and sending it to your git hub to work with others .
